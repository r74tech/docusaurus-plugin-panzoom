# User Interactions

For elements with pan and zoom functionality enabled, users can:

- **Pan**: Click and drag the element to move the view area
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel (and/or shift + mouse wheel) to zoom in and out of the element
- **Reset**: Double-click the element to reset to the original view state

If the toolbar is enabled, users can also use the toolbar buttons to zoom in, zoom out, and reset the view. See the
[Configuration](03-getting-started/02-configuration.md) section to learn how to enable/disable the toolbar.
